Project Overview
CSCI 326 (Software Engineering) – Class Project

ljgsjg

In this project, you and your partners will work to write a program that acts as a Math Tutoring Software System to help elementary school students. This project can be worked on outside of class but you must work with your partners! You and your partners must work together.  Everyone must code. Your goal is to create something that you’d want to show your future employer to help land that job!



Submission:

Share a link to all of your code and files
Turn in a hardcopy of the report at the beginning of the class (virtually through Canvas)
The Report format will be given out later
You must present and demonstrate your software in front of audience for each phase
You must prepare PPT (or equivalent slides) for each presentation.
Submission Date:  4 phases... TBD



Important Announcement:

Your program must include your name, date produced, and purpose of program as the header to your main file
You should have comments on each of class and method to make your program understandable. It should be well-documented and clean.
Failure to do 1, 2, and 3 will lose at least 20 points.
If your program has compiling errors, you will earn a zero immediately.
This project must be done in a team.
The instructor will not help any of the team while they are writing code. However, each team can discuss with the instructor any algorithm you developed.
If you do not present your work, you will get 0 points in this project.




Project Overview

This software will help elementary school students to study and practice math skills.  The math curriculum information in Massachusetts is in following link [begin on page 26]:

http://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/math/2017-06.pdfLinks to an external site.

The client requests the following features at a minimum:

practice test materials
tutorials
printing test results/progress
different level tests for each grade
security(log-in, log-out)
a reward for the user

This software works for grade k through grade 4.

You must create at least 5 different types of questions which cover at least 3 of the standards in the documentation link above.
